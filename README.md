This should be fairly simple.

-The first file, 'movement', contains movement functions

-The second file, 'sensing', contains sensing functions

-The third file, 'logic', contains the algorithm functions

-The final file, 'robot.py', is the actual final file.

(The 'omni-dir' file is for omni-directional movement. I don't expect us to use it, 
but I made it because I was bored and had 10 minutes. Feel free to work on it if you want)

Once the other files are done, we should be able to simply import * from logic
and run a 'main' function. Therefore, it is imperative that each module is independent, to avoid complications

You can work on any function in any file, but I would recommend storing a local copy of any file you are working on,
so that you can work on it without being interrupted by other people's changes. When you are done, you can then change the file in the repository.

If I think of anything else, I or someone else will add it here or to the docstrings in the separate files.
